\title{Calculate MID Importance}
\usage{
mid.importance(
  object,
  data = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  sort = TRUE,
  measure = 1L,
  max.nsamples = 10000L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a "mid" object.}

\item{data}{a data frame containing the observations to calculate the importance. If not provided, data is automatically extracted based on the function call.}

\item{weights}{an optional numeric vector of sample weights.}

\item{sort}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the output data frame is sorted by importance in descending order.}

\item{measure}{an integer specifying the measure of importance. Possible alternatives are \code{1} for the mean absolute effect, \code{2} for the root mean square effect, and \code{3} for the median absolute effect.}

\item{max.nsamples}{an integer specifying the maximum number of samples to retain in the \code{predictions} component of the returned object. If the number of observations exceeds this value, a weighted random sample is taken.}
}
\value{
\code{mid.importance()} returns an object of class "mid.importance". This is a list containing the following components:
\item{importance}{a data frame with the calculated importance values, sorted by default.}
\item{predictions}{the matrix of the fitted or predicted MID values. If the number of observations exceeds \code{max.nsamples}, this matrix contains a sampled subset.}
\item{measure}{a character string describing the type of the importance measure used.}
}
\description{
\code{mid.importance()} calculates the MID importance of a fitted MID model.
This is a measure of feature importance that quantifies the average contribution of each component function across a dataset.
}
\details{
The MID importance of a component function \eqn{g_S}, where \eqn{S} represents a single feature \eqn{\{j\}} or a feature pair \eqn{\{j, k\}}, is defined as the mean absolute effect on the predictions within the given data:

\deqn{\mathbf{I}(g_S) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |g_S(\mathbf{x}_{i,S})|}

Terms with higher importance values have a larger average impact on the model's overall predictions. Because all components (main effects and interactions) are measured on the same scale as the response variable, these values provide a direct and comparable measure of each term's contribution to the model.

data(airquality, package = "datasets")
mid <- interpret(Ozone ~ .^2, data = airquality, lambda = 1)

# Calculate MID importance using median absolute contribution
imp <- mid.importance(mid, data = airquality)
print(imp)

# Calculate MID importance using root mean square contribution
imp <- mid.importance(mid, measure = 2)

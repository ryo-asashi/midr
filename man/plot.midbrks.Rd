\usage{
\method{plot}{midbrks}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a "mid.breakdown" object to be visualized.}

\item{...}{optional parameters passed on to the graphing function. Possible arguments are "col", "fill", "pch", "cex", "lty", "lwd" and aliases of them.}
}
\value{
\code{plot.midlist.breakdown()} produces a plot as a side effect and returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
For "mid.breakdown" objects, \code{plot()} visualizes the breakdown of a prediction by component functions.
}
\details{
This is an S3 method for the \code{plot()} generic that produces a breakdown plot from a "mid.breakdown" object, visualizing the contribution of each component function to a single prediction.

The \code{type} argument controls the visualization style.
The default, \code{type = "waterfall"}, creates a waterfall plot that shows how the prediction builds from the intercept, with each term's contribution sequentially added or subtracted.
The \code{type = "barplot"} option creates a standard bar plot where the length of each bar represents the magnitude of the term's contribution.
The \code{type = "dotchart"} option creates a dot plot showing the contribution of each term as a point connected to a zero baseline.

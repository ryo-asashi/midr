\title{Combine MID Objects}
\usage{
midlist(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{objects to be combined. All inputs must inherit from exactly one of the supported base classes: "mid", "midimp", "midcon", or "midbrk". Collection classes (e.g., "mids"-"midrib", "midimps"-"midlist") are also accepted and will be flattened appropriately.}
}
\value{
\code{midlist()} returns a list-based collection object inheriting from "midlist" and the appropriate collection class (e.g., "midcons"-"midlist").
If a single "midrib" object is provided, the original object is returned as-is.
}
\description{
Combines multiple MID models ("mid") or their interpretation results ("midimp", "midcon", "midbrk") into a unified collection object.
This is useful for grouping models and their explanations together for seamless comparison, summary, and visualization.
}
\details{
The \code{midlist()} function acts as a polymorphic constructor for collection objects.
Depending on the class of the input objects, it automatically assigns the appropriate classes (e.g., "mid" objects become a "mids"-"midlist" collection; "midimp" objects become a "midimps"-"midlist" collection).
All objects provided in \code{...} must belong to the same base class.

If a single "midrib" object is provided, it is returned as-is, preserving its optimized struct-of-arrays format.
However, if a "midrib" object is combined with other objects via \code{...}, it is automatically coerced into a pure list (array of structures) to ensure structural consistency before concatenation.

\examples{
# Fit models using the built-in anscombe dataset
fit_1 <- lm(cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ x1, data = anscombe)
fit_2 <- lm(y4 ~ x4, data = anscombe)

# Create interpretation objects
# mid_1 is a "midrib" collection containing 3 models
mid_1 <- interpret(cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ x1, data = anscombe, model = fit_1)
# mid_2 is a single "mid" object
mid_2 <- interpret(y4 ~ x4, data = anscombe, model = fit_2)

# Combine a "midrib" and a "mid" into a single "midlist" collection.
mid_collection <- midlist(mid_1, y4 = mid_2)

# Check the labels of the combined collection
labels(mid_collection)

# The resulting object is a flat list of models
class(mid_collection)
}

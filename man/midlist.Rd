\title{Create a Collection of MID Models}
\usage{
midlist(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{"mid", "midlist", or "midrib" objects to be combined.}
}
\value{
A "midlist" object, which is a list of "mid" objects. If a single "midrib" object is provided in \code{...}, the original object is returned as-is.
}
\description{
Combines multiple "mid", "midlist", or "midrib" objects into a single "midlist" object.
This is useful for grouping models together for comparison, summary, or visualization.
}
\details{
A "midlist" is a standard R list containing only "mid" objects.
When multiple arguments are passed to \code{midlist()}, they are coerced and flattened into a single list of models.

If a single "midrib" object is provided, it is returned as-is, preserving its optimized struct-of-arrays format.
However, if a "midrib" object is combined with other objects via \code{...}, it is automatically coerced into a pure list (array of structures) to ensure structural consistency before concatenation.

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of the 'midr' package. In this version I have:

-   Updated the description field of DESCRIPTION file to avoid unexplained acronyms.
-   Added a reference to the package article in the DESCRIPTION file.

Additionally, many functions have been updated for new features and improvements.

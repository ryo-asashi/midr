-   This is a new release.

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of the 'midr' package. In this version, I have addressed the previous comments as follows:

-   Added the \`\\value\` section to the documentation for \`scale_color_theme()\` (\`man/scale_color_theme.Rd\`).

-   Corrected the example in \`color.theme()\` (\`man/color.theme.Rd\`) to ensure that graphical parameters (\`par()\`) are reset on exit.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,\
Ryoichi Asashiba [aut, cre]

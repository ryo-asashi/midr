Description:
  The goal of 'midr' is to provide a model-agnostic method to interpret and explain black-box predictive models by creating a globally interpretable surrogate based on Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID), a functional decomposition technique that minimizes the squared error between the target model predictions and the predictions of the surrogate model. For the theoretical foundations of MID, please refer to Iwasawa & Matsumori (2025) [Forthcoming]. For technical details of the midr package, please see Asashiba et al. (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.08338>.

Description:
  midr is designed to provide a model-agnostic method for interpreting black-box machine learning models by creating a globally interpretable surrogate of the target model using a functional decomposition technique called Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID).
  For the theoretical details of MID, see Iwasawa & Matsumori (2025) <d>[Forthcoming], and for the technical details of the package, see Asashiba et al. (2025) [Forthcoming].
